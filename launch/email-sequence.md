## Email 2: Power Tips (Day 3)

**Subject:** 3 imgcrush tricks you probably missed

**Body:**

Hey {first_name},

Now that you've had a few days with imgcrush, here are 3 power-user tips:

### 1. CI/CD Integration

Add image optimization to your build pipeline:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions
- name: Optimize images
  run: imgcrush ./public/ --json --recursive --quality 80
```

The `--json` flag outputs machine-readable results with exit codes.

### 2. Smart Quality

For web images, `--quality 85` is usually the sweet spot — visually
identical to 100 but 40-60% smaller files.

```bash
imgcrush ./assets/ --quality 85 --format webp
```

### 3. Dry Run First

Preview exactly what will change before committing:

```bash
imgcrush ./images/ --dry-run --verbose
```

Shows file sizes, estimated savings, and which Metal device will be used.

How's imgcrush working for you? Hit reply — I'd love to hear your use case.

## Email 3: Cloud Upsell (Day 7)

**Subject:** Process images from anywhere — imgcrush Cloud (early access)

**Body:**

Hey {first_name},

Quick question: do you ever need to optimize images on a server,
in a web app, or from a team that doesn't all use macOS?

I'm building **imgcrush Cloud** — the same optimization engine,
accessible via API from anywhere:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.imgcrush.dev/optimize \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "image=@photo.png" \
  -F "quality=85" \
  -F "format=webp"
```

**Early access features:**
- REST API with the same quality as the CLI
- Web dashboard for drag & drop
- Webhook notifications when processing completes
- Team accounts with usage analytics

**Interested?** Reply "cloud" and I'll add you to the early access list.
Early access users get 50% off the first 6 months.
